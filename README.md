1. Introduction  
The healthcare industry generates massive amounts of data that can be analyzed to extract meaningful insights.  
Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, plays a crucial role in processing complex medical data.  
It helps in identifying patterns that may not be immediately obvious to human analysts.  
In this project, machine learning algorithms will be used to classify different diseases based on patient data.

2. Objectives  
• To understand the role of machine learning in healthcare.  
• To explore different machine learning algorithms for disease classification.  
• To perform data preprocessing and feature selection for accurate prediction.  
• To build and evaluate a classification model for disease prediction.

3. Literature Survey  
Several studies have demonstrated the potential of machine learning in predicting diseases.  
Researchers have used algorithms like Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.  
These algorithms help in identifying relationships between various features in patient data.  
Effective preprocessing and selection of relevant features are critical for improving model accuracy.

4. Methodology  
• Data Collection: Gather patient data from reliable sources or public datasets.  
• Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.  
• Feature Selection: Identify important features that contribute to disease prediction.  
• Model Building: Apply machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, SVM, etc.  
• Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
